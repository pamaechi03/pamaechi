<h1 style="text-align:center;">ABOUT ME</h1>
</b>

<p> 
I am a Freshmen at the University of Texas at Austin planning to major in Finance. I was born in Houston, TX but started school in Anambra, Nigeria. Experiencing a different country at such a young age changed a lot about how I view the world. I am really appreciative and understanding of different cultures and values. My favorite foods include Mac and Cheese, Plaintains, and Fufu. I love learning about finance and believe in the importance of personal financial literacy.

<p> I love hanging out with my friends in my free time. I love technology. Ever since I was 10, I have always been fascinated my computers. The first computer I ever took apart was a Dell Vostro laptop. I learned some basic HTML and C++ at 12. I learned to dual boot and install various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Chromium OS, and gnome. I have always loved technology! </p>
